# Role Management

[This page does not go over reaction roles, click this text to go there instead](https://docs.carl.gg/roles/reaction-roles)

!!! info
    These commands are for administrators to manage role assignments in their servers. The bot might mention it or you requiring additional permissions despite having `manage roles`. To fix this, make sure both you and the bot have roles higher in the role hierarchy than the role you're trying to assign.

	Ranks are roles that have been authorized by a server Admin or Moderator for self-assignment through the use of the `rank` command by users. This system is similar to `iam` commands in other bots.
	
	| Name | Example | Usage |
	| :--- | :--- | :--- |
	| **addrank &lt;roles1020726750516363416...&gt;** | !addrank fortnite weeb "f1 fanatic" "koishi fanboy" "tomato lover" | Adds one or more roles to the list of authorized ranks that members can assign to themselves. |
	| **removerank &lt;roles...&gt;** | !removerank fortnite "f1 fanatic" | Removes one or more roles from the list of authorized ranks, so that it can no longer be self assigned. |
	| **ranks** | !ranks | Lists all authorized ranks. |
	| **rank &lt;role&gt;** | !rank fortnite | Adds/removes the role to the person who used the command. Requires the role to be on the list of authorized ranks. |
